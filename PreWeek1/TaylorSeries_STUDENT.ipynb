    "A Taylor Series is the representation of **any** function as a _Series_ of polynomials. And by representation we mean that any function has an exact parallel in the form of an infinite sum of polynomials.  However, we will mostly use approximations that are _almost_ exact as computers don't work well with anything infinite.  While we won't be working with Taylor Series, we will be working with Fourier Series which is the same idea, except using cosine and sine to represent functions instead of polynomials.\n",
